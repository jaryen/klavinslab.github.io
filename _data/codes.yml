  title: AlphaSeq Mating Dynamics
  author: Eric Klavins
  description: Alpha-Seq is a technology developed by David Younger, former graduate
               student in the Klavins Lab and now CEO of A-Alpha Bio. 
               With Alpha-Seq, you re-program yeast mating by replacing the natural
               agglutinins with custom proteins. Using massive libraries of proteins,
               mating and sporulation, you can get some pretty interesting dynamics.
               This notebook shows how to model the A-Alpha system and illustrates
               the model with a few different examples.

  description: This very simple notebook uses a grid world to illustrate how
               reinforcement learning works.

  title: Chemical Reaction Networks
  author: Eric Klavins
  description: This notebook shows how to take a syntactic description of a chemical
               reaction network (eg. A + B -> C) and derive the mass action kinetics,
               the moment dynamics, and Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm.
