  title: "Expanding Synthetic Cell-Cell Communication: Inspiration from the Immune System"
  abstract: The state of the art for synthetic cell-cell communication systems involves the production and secretion of 
    small molecules or peptides, which allows for a limited number of discernible interaction “wires” between cell types. 
    Complex natural systems, such as the human immune system, may involve billions of unique cell types with billions of 
    unique and highly specific communication wires. This is possible due to the use of direct protein interactions on the 
    cells’ surface as a signaling modality rather than secretion and detection. Here, yeast sexual agglutination has been 
    re-engineered such that mating is controlled by the interaction strength of arbitrary proteins expressed on the surface 
    of haploid cells. This approach provides a nearly endless number of highly specific communication wires between a 
    diverse population of cells, and opens the door to novel applications for protein engineering, environmental sensing, 
    and population-level cellular computation.

  title: Stochastic Models for DNA Tandem Duplication
  abstract: The genome of every organism is subject to mutations resulting from environmental factors as well as imperfect
    genome replication. A better understanding of these mutations is helpful in many areas including computational biology,
    medicine, phylogenomics, molecular programming, and bioinformatics. For example to enable in vivo synthetic biology methods
    and algorithms that need memory, e.g., to store information about their state or to record changes in the environment,
    it is important to determine the prevalence and properties of different types of mutations, since such information is
    needed to design sufficiently resilient error-correcting codes for data storage in the DNA of living organisms. In
    this talk, we present a stochastic model for DNA tandem duplication that also incorporates point mutations. We study
    this model by approximating discrete processes by continuous ones in a stochastic approximation framework, which enables
    us to characterize certain properties of likely outcomes and estimate the rates of point mutations and tandem duplications
    as well as the distribution of the lengths of tandem duplications. In addition to being useful for DNA storage,
    the mutation rate estimates obtained via this method can be used to approximate distances between genomic sequences
    for phylogenetic tree reconstruction.

  title: Duplication Correcting Codes for DNA Storage
  abstract: The ability to store data in DNA has applications in a variety of areas including synthetic biology and 
    watermarking of patented genetically modified organisms. Data stored in this medium is subject to errors caused by 
    substitutions, indels and duplications. We develop error correcting codes for errors that occur by tandem duplication. 
    We consider constant length and bounded length tandem duplication channels. The code constructed can correct any number 
    of errors for both channel types. Moreover for the constant length channel, the code construction is optimal.

  title: Robust digital logic circuits in eukaryotic cells with CRISPR/dCas9 NOR gates
  abstract: Natural genetic circuits cells make sophisticated digital decisions. Building equally complex synthetic circuits 
    in eukaryotes remains difficult because many commonly used genetic components leak transcriptionally, do not allow
    arbitrary interconnections, and do not have very digital responses. Here, we designed a new dCas9-Mxi1 
    based NOR gate architecture in S. cerevisiae that allows arbitrary connectivity and large genetic circuits. 
    Because we use the strong chromatin remodeler Mxi1, our system shows very little leak and exhibits very digital response. 
    In particular, we built a combinatorial library of NOR gates that each directly convert guide RNA (gRNA) input signals into 
    gRNA output signals, enabling NOR gates to be wired together with. We constructed and characterized logic circuits with up 
    to eight independent gRNAs, including repression cascades with up to seven layers. Modeling predicted that the NOR gates have
    Hill Coefficients of approximately 1.7, explaining the minimal signal degradation we observed in these deeply layered
    circuits. Our approach enables the construction of the largest, eukaryotic gene circuits to date and will form the basis for
    large, synthetic, decision making systems in living cells.

  title: Rapid cell-free forward engineering of novel genetic ring oscillators
  abstract: While complex dynamic biological networks control gene expression in all living organisms, the forward engineering 
    of comparable synthetic networks remains challenging. The current paradigm of characterizing synthetic networks in cells 
    results in lengthy design-build-test cycles, minimal data collection, and poor quantitative characterization. Cell-free 
    systems are appealing alternative environments, but it remains questionable whether biological networks behave similarly 
    in cell-free systems and in cells. We characterized in a cell-free system the 'repressilator,' a three-node synthetic oscillator. 
    We then engineered novel three, four, and five-gene ring architectures, from characterization of circuit components to 
    rapid analysis of complete networks. When implemented in cells, our novel 3-node networks produced population-wide 
    synchronized oscillations and 95 percent of 5-node oscillator cells oscillated for up to 72 hours. Oscillation periods in 
    cells matched the cell-free system results for all networks tested. An alternate forward engineering paradigm using 
    cell-free systems can thus accurately capture cellular behavior.
