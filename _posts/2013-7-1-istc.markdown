The UW <a href="http://istc-pc.washington.edu/">Intel Center for
Pervasive Computing (ISTC)</a> has named the "Smart Wetlab" as one of
its two capstone projects. Why is Intel interested in synthetic
biology? It turns out that biofabrication and microfabrication have a
lot in common. Manufactuing processes need to be
reproducible. Technician training needs to be reliable. The Intel ISTC
is interested using new technology to help people do their jobs better.
