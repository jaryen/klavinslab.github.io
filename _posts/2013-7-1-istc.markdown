The UW <a href="http://istc-pc.washington.edu/">Intel Center for
Pervasive Computing (ISTC)</a> has named the "Smart Wetlab" as one of
its two capstone projects. This means Aquarium workstations will be
augmented with sensors and Aquarium will be used as a testbed by ISTC
researchers working on everything from activity recognition to natural
lagnuage processing. Why is Intel interested in synthetic biology?
First of all, The Intel ISTC is interested in making new technology
pervasive in everyday life, including in the workplace. And it turns
out that biofabrication and microfabrication have a lot in
common. Manufactuing processes need to be reproducible. Technician
training needs to be reliable. The synthetic biology lab is, thus,
perfect for trying out new ways to help people do their work by
tracking their samples, providing a video-enriched lab notebook,
outfitting everything with sensors, and using activity recognition and
machine learning to provide real time suggestions.
