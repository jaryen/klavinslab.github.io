<img src='/images/pie.png' class='image'></img> The first big test of
Aquarium is to use it to teach UW's Laboratory Methods for Synthetic
Biology course in the Winter 2014 quarter. In the first five weeks
students learn basic laboratory skills, molecular cloning, Gibson
assembly, and how to knock out genes using the Keio method. We write
the protocols and methods in Plankton and Oyster, and Aquarium does
the rest while we sit back and watch the data accumulate. In the
second five weeks, the students will learn to write their own
protocols and run them on Aquarium. So far, after the first week and a
few bugfixes, the system is running like a charm! Two hundred sixteen
jobs, which about 75% of the successful and most of the rest just
cancelled because they were scheduled accidentally.
