Our collaborators at the [Intel ISTC on Pervasive Computing](http://istc-pc.washington.edu/) have been outfitting our lab with a variety of cameras and other sensors to capture what the Aquarium technicians are doing. They take the video and apply amazing activity recognition methods to parse the activity into useful information that could help debug protocols, train new technicians, and improve workflow. Below is a montage of some of the various methods and angles they have tried. Thanks to Anthony LeMarca (Intel) for putting this video together!
