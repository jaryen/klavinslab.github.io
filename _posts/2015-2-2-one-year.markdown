Aquarium has been up and running in the Klavins lab for a little over a year. Since that time, we've seen big changes. Initially, not everyone in the lab wanted to use the system. They had to put all of their samples into the inventory management system, they had to give up control over their own Gibson assemblies, they had to learn a new system.

Plus, Aquarium was initially pretty buggy and limited in what it could do. Since then, we've gone through three different protocol representation languages, produced over 11,000 items in the inventory, and run thousands of jobs. We are currently running more than 350 jobs per week between research and teaching. These jobs are associated with a growing library of more than 200 protocols ranging from preparing media to Gibson assembly to flow cytometry. New protocols are added and tested every month.

And we continue to grow. By May of 2015, we will have added two new technicians and we are looking for a lab manager to run the system on weekends. Interested? See <a href='http://klavinslab.org/positions.html'>here</a> for positions available.
