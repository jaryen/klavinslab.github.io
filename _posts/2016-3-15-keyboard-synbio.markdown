We just finished teaching EE/CSE/BIOEN 425: Laboratory Methods in Synthetic Biology. This year we tried something very different. We had students design their DNA and strains in <a href="https://github.com/klavinslab/coral">Coral</a>, and use the Aquarium Python API to upload their jobs into Aquarium. Then they sit back and watch as their experiments are done by our technicians. How's that for a laboratory method? It was great to see how easily computer science and electrical engineering students were able to understand synthetic biology when you abstract all of the details of the lab.
