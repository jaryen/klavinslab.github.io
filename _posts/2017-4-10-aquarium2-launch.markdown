Aquarium version 2.0 is in beta testing now with a select group of UW users. The new version features completely modular, strongly typed operations that are composable into many different workflows. It has an integrated design environment for building new operation types and their associated protocols. Protocols can be tested with the click of a button with randomly generated i/o.

The Aquarium Workflow Language (AWL) is incredibly concise, and has allowed us to refactor our protocols to have about 50% as much code. Finally, Aquarium 2.0 has a planner that automatically backchains from a desired goal to produce a task-specific plan meeting the researcher's needs. Join the BIOFAB staff on April 14, 2017 in EE 403 for the Aquarium 2.0 launch party! You'll get a BIOFAB t-shirt!!
