At the heart of any good organization you will find creative, passionate, and dedicated people. At the BIOFAB we are incredibly lucky to have two excellent lab managers: Michelle Parks, and Cameron Coudrey. They are in charge of day to day operations such as running protocols, maintaining the inventory, keeping the lab safe, and managing and training technicians. They also invent new processes, provide strategy and tactics, organize new systems, help customers, and track down bugs.

Most importantly, Michelle and Cami implement the vision of the BIOFAB as an end-to-end cloud-based lab that runs our customer's experiments inexpensively, quickly, and reproducibly. Connecting that vision to the reality in the lab is no easy task, but they do it with grace and skill. We are incredily fortunate to have them running the show.
