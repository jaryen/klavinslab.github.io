Aquarium is undergoing rapid development, with several new minor releases appearing since Aquarium 2.0 came out. The latest
version will include much better documentation, a docker installer, and improvements to the plan designer / editor. We also
are introducing Trident, a python library for interacting with Aquarium that allows you to define your samples and experiments
in code, and extract your data from Aquarium to send to whatever analysis software you might like to use in Python.  
We have made the Aquarium github repo public. It is free for academic and non-profit research use. Industry folks should
contact <a mailto="licence@uw.edu">license@uw.edu</a>. A new web page for Aquarium is
<a href="http://klavinslab.org/aquarium">here</a>, where you can learn about the details.
