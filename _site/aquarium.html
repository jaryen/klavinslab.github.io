        <h3 id="A Year of Data">A Year of Data</h3>
    <p><span class='date'>Monday, February 02, 2015</span><br /><p>Aquarium has been up and running in the Klavins lab for a little over a year. Since that time, we&#39;ve seen big changes. Initially, not everyone in the lab wanted to use the system. They had to put all of their samples into the inventory management system, they had to give up control over their own Gibson assemblies, they had to learn a new system. 
<img src='/images/one-year.jpg' class='image' style='width: 300px'></img>
Plus, Aquarium was initially pretty buggy and limited in what it could do. Since then, we&#39;ve gone through three different protocol representation languages, produced over 11,000 items in the inventory, and run hundres of jobs. We are currently running more than 350 jobs per week between research and teaching. These jobs are associated with a growing library of more than 200 protocols ranging from preparing media to Gibson assembly to flow cytometry. New protocols are added and tested every week.</p>

<p>And we continue to grow. By May of 2015, we will have addedtwo new technicians and we are looking for a lab manager to run the system on weekends. Interested? See <a href='http://klavinslab.org/positions.html'>here</a> for positions available.</p>

        <h3 id="New Technicans!">New Technicans!</h3>
    <p><span class='date'>Saturday, November 01, 2014</span><br /><p>We now have five wonderful Aquarium technicians each working half time in the lab. Toghether with our amazing lab manager Michelle Parks, the technicians now do 99% of the cloning (Gibson Assembly) and media prepration in the Klavins lab, and they do cloning for our some of our collaborators in the Seelig, Nemhauser, and Carothers labs.
<img src='/images/aquarium_techs_fall_2014.jpg' class='image' style='width: 300px'></img>
They also do about 60% of the yeast work, including integration, verification, flow cytometry, and similar protocols. Each technician is an undergraduate student with little or no prior background in molecular biology lab work. To train them, we use the same set of protocols we use to teach our <i>Laboratory Methods in Synthetic Biology</i> course. The also get careful supervision by Michelle to learn everything that is not in Aquarium. It takes a new technician about a month to get up to speed, and then they are cloning away.</p>

    <p><span class='date'>Wednesday, August 27, 2014</span><br /><p>Our collaborators at the <a href="http://istc-pc.washington.edu/">Intel ISTC on Pervasive Computing</a> have been outfitting our lab with a variety of cameras and other sensors to capture what the Aquarium technicians are doing. They take the video and apply amazing activity recognition methods to parse the activity into useful information that could help debug protocols, train new technicians, and improve workflow. Below is a montage of some of the various methods and angles they have tried. Thanks to Anthony LeMarca (Intel) for putting this video together!</p>

        <h3 id="TEDx: Programming Biology">TEDx: Programming Biology</h3>
    <p><span class='date'>Tuesday, July 01, 2014</span><br /><p>Prof. Eric Klavins recently spoke at a independently organized TEDx
event on programming biology and described the motivation for
Aquarium. Until approximately 2008, Klavins lab research was primarily
in computer science and robotics. At about that time, Eric learned the
basics of genetic engineering completely switched fields to synthetic
biology and now runs an interdisciplinary group of engineers,
biologists, experimentalists, and theorists -- all focused on
engineering life. In particular, Eric&#39;s research concerns developing
programming languages and abstractions that can be used to design,
fabricate, test, and refine new organisms. Example applications
include synthetic multicellular consortia that digest plant matter and
produce biofuels, diagnose disease, or assemble into complex patterns
and shapes. This talk describes an outsiders view on the biology lab,
how biology labs are different from engineering, and the thought
process that went into the Aquarium project.</p>

    <p><span class='date'>Thursday, May 08, 2014</span><br /><p>The UW Center for Innovation annouces funding for Aqaurium in the
classroom. Here&#39;s the description: <i>A group of faculty from the Intel
Science and Technology Center for Pervasive Computing will collaborate
with faculty in the synthetic biology program tobuild a
semi-automated, human-in-the-loop laboratory. For this framework
protocols and methods will be encoded in a new programming
language. Software will guide students through every step of every
protocol with touchscreen interfaces, simple text, images, movies and
otherfeatures. Sensors such as cameras, Google Glasses and
radio-frequency identifications tags will monitor supplies, reagents
and equipment as the protocols are being performed. Detailed logs will
be used to refine protocols and methods and to catch mistakes. The
goal for teaching will be to develop a sequence of life sciences
research protocols students work through independently and then
refine. Subsequently we will teach the students how to author their
own protocols and methods. Through this process students will learn
basic protocols, how to author new protocols and methods, and how to
design and test a new organism from first principles. The course melds
engineering, computer science and life sciences into a hands-on
experience in synthetic biology.</i></p>

        <h3 id="First week of class">First week of class</h3>
    <p><span class='date'>Thursday, January 09, 2014</span><br /><p><img src='/images/pie.png' class='image'></img> The first big test of
Aquarium is to use it to teach UW&#39;s Laboratory Methods for Synthetic
Biology course in the Winter 2014 quarter. In the first five weeks
students learn basic laboratory skills, molecular cloning, Gibson
assembly, and how to knock out genes using the Keio method. We write
the protocols and methods in Plankton and Oyster, and Aquarium does
the rest while we sit back and watch the data accumulate. In the
second five weeks, the students will learn to write their own
protocols and run them on Aquarium. So far, after the first week and a
few bugfixes, the system is running like a charm! Two hundred sixteen
jobs, of which about 75% were successful and most of the rest just
cancelled because they were scheduled accidentally. </p>

<p>Update (Feb. 10): We&#39;re done with the first five weeks. Almost all
protocols were completed successfully, except some knockouts did not
work in the last week. The students are now breaking into groups to
write their own protocols and methods (everything from qPCR to measure
gene expression to gene assembly) to run in Aquarium. Each method will
be run once a week for four weeks (starting next week) by four
different groups. In between runs, students have a chance to improve
their protocols based on feedback from their peers.</p>

        <h3 id="ISTC Wetlab Capstone">ISTC Wetlab Capstone</h3>
    <p><span class='date'>Monday, July 01, 2013</span><br /><p>The UW <a href="http://istc-pc.washington.edu/">Intel Center for
Pervasive Computing (ISTC)</a> has named the &quot;Smart Wetlab&quot; as one of
its two capstone projects. This means Aquarium workstations will be
augmented with sensors and Aquarium will be used as a testbed by ISTC
researchers working on everything from activity recognition to natural
lagnuage processing. Why is Intel interested in synthetic biology?
First of all, The Intel ISTC is interested in making new technology
pervasive in everyday life, including in the workplace. And it turns
out that biofabrication and microfabrication have a lot in
common. Manufactuing processes need to be reproducible. Technician
training needs to be reliable. The synthetic biology lab is, thus,
perfect for trying out new ways to help people do their work by
tracking their samples, providing a video-enriched lab notebook,
outfitting everything with sensors, and using activity recognition and
machine learning to provide real time suggestions.</p>
