    <h2 id="sec0">The Aquarium Project</h2>

<p><img src='/aquarium_images/course.png' class='image'></img>
    A study in 2012 found that
<a href='http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v483/n7391/full/483531a.html#t1'>six of fifty-three </a>

selected 'landmark' papers in cancer biology were reproducible. 

<a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/17/science/rise-in-scientific-journal-retractions-prompts-calls-for-reform.html?pagewanted=all'>
Another</a>
found that retractions, due to
errors or otherwise, are increasingly frequent. The

<a href='http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21588069-scientific-research-has-changed-world-now-it-needs-change-itself-how-science-goes-wrong'>
bar for what makes a scientific result</a>

has either lowered, or the complexity of science has increased to
where the last century's methods no longer apply. Attempting to build
on scientific results in the life sciences, researchers in engineering
have begun to explore the study of engineering life itself, only to
find that said results do not hold. Even when a result is valid, the
methods are poorly explained, purposefully not explained, or simply
buried in some researcher's head.</p>

<p>The Aquarium Project aims to fix this problem by providing the means
to specify, as precisely as possible, how to obtain a
result. Researchers encode protocols in <i>Plankton</i>, specifying
how to manipulate items in the Aquarium inventory (test tubes,
pipettors, 96 well plates, etc) using a combination of formal
statements, informal descriptions, and photographs. Protocols are
parameterized by "tuning knobs" (such as incubation times or reagent
concentrations) that can be varied when the protocols are
scheduled. The researcher strings together protocols into processes
specified in <i>Oyster</i>, specifying how the output samples of one
protocol become the inputs to other protocols, and how protocols
can be scheduled, parallelized, and controlled.</p>

<p>Protocols and processes are scheduled and presented to technicians on
touchscreen monitors placed throughout the lab. Every step is logged:
who performed the step, which items were used, what data was gathered
by which instruments, and how long it took. Color and depth sensing
video cameras aimed at the technician, and other sensors sprinkled
throughout the lab, record the details of each step and are used to
annotate an automatically generated a lab notebook. The data can be used to
debug and improve the experiment. More importantly it provides a
complete, executable description of the results obtained -- one that
could be used by any lab running Aquarium to reproduce the result!</p>

    <p><span class='date'>Thursday, February 06, 2014</span><br /><p>The UW Center for Innovation annouces funding for Aqaurium in the
classroom. Here&#39;s their description: <i>A group of faculty from the Intel
Science and Technology Center for Pervasive Computing will collaborate
with faculty in the synthetic biology program tobuild a
semi-automated, human-in-the-loop laboratory. For this framework
protocols and methods will be encoded in a new programming
language. Software will guide students through every step of every
protocol with touchscreen interfaces, simple text, images, movies and
otherfeatures. Sensors such as cameras, Google Glasses and
radio-frequency identifications tags will monitor supplies, reagents
and equipment as the protocols are being performed. Detailed logs will
be used to refine protocols and methods and to catch mistakes. The
goal for teaching will be to develop a sequence of life sciences
research protocols students work through independently and then
refine. Subsequently we will teach the students how to author their
own protocols and methods. Through this process students will learn
basic protocols, how to author new protocols and methods, and how to
design and test a new organism from first principles. The course melds
engineering, computer science and life sciences into a hands-on
experience in synthetic biology.</i></p>

        <h3 id="First week of class">First week of class</h3>
    <p><span class='date'>Thursday, January 09, 2014</span><br /><p><img src='/images/pie.png' class='image'></img> The first big test of
Aquarium is to use it to teach UW&#39;s Laboratory Methods for Synthetic
Biology course in the Winter 2014 quarter. In the first five weeks
students learn basic laboratory skills, molecular cloning, Gibson
assembly, and how to knock out genes using the Keio method. We write
the protocols and methods in Plankton and Oyster, and Aquarium does
the rest while we sit back and watch the data accumulate. In the
second five weeks, the students will learn to write their own
protocols and run them on Aquarium. So far, after the first week and a
few bugfixes, the system is running like a charm! Two hundred sixteen
jobs, of which about 75% were successful and most of the rest just
cancelled because they were scheduled accidentally. </p>

<p>Update (Feb. 10): We&#39;re done with the first five weeks. Almost all
protocols were completed successfully, except some knockouts did not
work in the last week. The students are now breaking into groups to
write their own protocols and methods (everything from qPCR to measure
gene expression to gene assembly) to run in Aquarium. Each method will
be run once a week for four weeks (starting next week) by four
different groups. In between runs, students have a chance to improve
their protocols based on feedback from their peers.</p>

        <h3 id="ISTC Wetlab Capstone">ISTC Wetlab Capstone</h3>
    <p><span class='date'>Monday, July 01, 2013</span><br /><p>The UW <a href="http://istc-pc.washington.edu/">Intel Center for
Pervasive Computing (ISTC)</a> has named the &quot;Smart Wetlab&quot; as one of
its two capstone projects. This means Aquarium workstations will be
augmented with sensors and Aquarium will be used as a testbed by ISTC
researchers working on everything from activity recognition to natural
lagnuage processing. Why is Intel interested in synthetic biology?
First of all, The Intel ISTC is interested in making new technology
pervasive in everyday life, including in the workplace. And it turns
out that biofabrication and microfabrication have a lot in
common. Manufactuing processes need to be reproducible. Technician
training needs to be reliable. The synthetic biology lab is, thus,
perfect for trying out new ways to help people do their work by
tracking their samples, providing a video-enriched lab notebook,
outfitting everything with sensors, and using activity recognition and
machine learning to provide real time suggestions.</p>
