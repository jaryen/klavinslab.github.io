<p>The UW Center for Innovation annouces funding for Aqaurium in the
classroom. Here&#39;s their description: <i>A group of faculty from the Intel
Science and Technology Center for Pervasive Computing will collaborate
with faculty in the synthetic biology program tobuild a
semi-automated, human-in-the-loop laboratory. For this framework
protocols and methods will be encoded in a new programming
language. Software will guide students through every step of every
protocol with touchscreen interfaces, simple text, images, movies and
otherfeatures. Sensors such as cameras, Google Glasses and
radio-frequency identifications tags will monitor supplies, reagents
and equipment as the protocols are being performed. Detailed logs will
be used to refine protocols and methods and to catch mistakes. The
goal for teaching will be to develop a sequence of life sciences
research protocols students work through independently and then
refine. Subsequently we will teach the students how to author their
own protocols and methods. Through this process students will learn
basic protocols, how to author new protocols and methods, and how to
design and test a new organism from first principles. The course melds
engineering, computer science and life sciences into a hands-on
experience in synthetic biology.</i></p>
