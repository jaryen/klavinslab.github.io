<p>The Aquarium code and a protocol library called Aqualib are nearly
ready to be released. If you are interested in trying it out and
helping us debug the installation and setup procedure, please contact
Eric at the address klavins at the domain uw dot edu.</p>

<p>A few details: The main interface runs as a web server and was built
with Ruby/Rails. Aquarium&#39;s laboratory information system uses MySQL
or any other Rails supported database. The Plankton protocol compiler
and the Oyster metacol interpreter are written in Ruby and are
integrated into Aquarium. Aquarium expects that protocols in Plankton
and metacols in Oyster are stored in a git repository. You can link to
Aqualib and to any repositories you make as well. If you have images
you would like to put into your protocols, you can configure an image
server (the easiest thing to do just put them on dedicated web
server).</p>

<p>A simple installation works on a laptop (mostly tested with Mac OS X)
and uses a simple sqlite3 database. We use such a setup when
developing Aquarium. A complete production-level installation runs two
servers using MySQL on separate ports, one for production and one for
rehearsal. The researsal server can copy the production server&#39;s
database so you can practice protocols without messing up important
data. We use Apache and Phusion/Passenger to serve Aquarium.</p>

<p>Alpha testers get access to all the code and protocols as well as
documentation for how to install Aquarium, how to write protocols and
metacols in Plankton and Oyster, and how to use the Aquarium interface.</p>
