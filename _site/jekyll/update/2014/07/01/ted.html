<p>Prof. Eric Klavins recently spoke at a independently organized TEDx
event on programming biology and described the motivation for
Aquarium. Until approximately 2008, Klavins lab research was primarily
in computer science and robotics. At about that time, Eric learned the
basics of genetic engineering completely switched fields to synthetic
biology and now runs an interdisciplinary group of engineers,
biologists, experimentalists, and theorists -- all focused on
engineering life. In particular, Eric&#39;s research concerns developing
programming languages and abstractions that can be used to design,
fabricate, test, and refine new organisms. Example applications
include synthetic multicellular consortia that digest plant matter and
produce biofuels, diagnose disease, or assemble into complex patterns
and shapes. This talk describes an outsiders view on the biology lab,
how biology labs are different from engineering, and the thought
process that went into the Aquarium project.</p>
