<p>We now have five wonderful Aquarium technicians each working half time in the lab. Toghether with our amazing lab manager Michelle Parks, the technicians now do 99% of the cloning (Gibson Assembly) and media prepration in the Klavins lab, and they do cloning for our some of our collaborators in the Seelig, Nemhauser, and Carothers labs.

They also do about 60% of the yeast work, including integration, verification, flow cytometry, and similar protocols. Each technician is an undergraduate student with little or no prior background in molecular biology lab work. To train them, we use the same set of protocols we use to teach our <i>Laboratory Methods in Synthetic Biology</i> course. The also get careful supervision by Michelle to learn everything that is not in Aquarium. It takes a new technician about a month to get up to speed, and then they are cloning away.</p>
