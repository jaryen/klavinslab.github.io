<p>We just finished teaching EE/CSE/BIOEN 425: Laboratory Methods in Synthetic Biology. We were even more successful than last year, with students building and testing all sorts of CRISPR/dCas9 circuits based on Miles Ganderâ€™s technology (http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/03/02/041871). As part of the ISTC smart wetlab project, we also installed three cameras on each lab bench workstation and collected a total of 18 TB of video data showing each step in each protocol that was done by the students. They all agreed to be recorded, by the way. Our machine learning collaborators will be crunching these data for quite a while!</p>
