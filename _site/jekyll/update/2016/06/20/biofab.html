<p>We are happy to annouce the <a href="http://www.uwbiofab.org/">UW BIOFAB</a>, a new UW cost center. Researchers at the University of Washington may use the Aquarium software to  remotely submit molecular biology and microbiology jobs. Technicians in the BIOFAB execute the protocols following Aquarium workflows and upload the results into the Aquarium database. Cloning projects can be executed from start to finish, without the client ever having to touch a pipette! Records of all jobs and samples are permanently stored in the Aquarium inventory database, eliminating the need for messy lab notebooks and complex inventory systems. Thanks to Michelle Parks, Yaoyu Yang, and Tina Montgomery for all of their hard work making this happen.</p>
