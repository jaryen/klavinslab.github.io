<p>The UW BIOFAB has been awarded a new contract by DARPA to be on of three cloud labs running synthetic biology experiments for the
<a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/synergistic-discovery-and-design">Synergystic Discovery and Design</a> program. This program
supports dozens of researchers in synthetic biology, machine learning, and high performance computing. The goal is to create a 
complete software/hardware pipeline going from experimental design, to experimental execution, to data storage, to data analysis
for synthetic biology. The other cloud labs are Ginkgo Bioworks and Transcriptic, and our computing partners include the
Texas Advanced Computing Center. The Aquarium software will play a central role in our work, allowing us to manage experiments, but
also connect to upstream design software and downstream analysis software developed by other research groups.</p>
