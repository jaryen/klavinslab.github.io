    A study in 2012 found that
<a href='http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v483/n7391/full/483531a.html#t1'>six of fifty-three </a>

selected 'landmark' papers in cancer biology were reproducible.

Another</a>
found that retractions, due to
errors or otherwise, are increasingly frequent. The

<a href='http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21588069-scientific-research-has-changed-world-now-it-needs-change-itself-how-science-goes-wrong'>
bar for what makes a scientific result</a>

has either lowered, or the complexity of science has increased to
where the last century's methods no longer apply. Attempting to build
on scientific results in the life sciences, researchers in engineering
have begun to explore the study of engineering life itself, only to
find that said results do not hold. Even when a result is valid, the
methods are poorly explained, purposefully not explained, or simply
buried in some researcher's head.</p>

<p>The Aquarium Project aims to fix this problem by providing the means
to specify, as precisely as possible, how to obtain a
result. Researchers encode protocols in <i>Plankton</i>, specifying
how to manipulate items in the Aquarium inventory (test tubes,
pipettors, 96 well plates, etc) using a combination of formal
statements, informal descriptions, and photographs. Protocols are
parameterized by "tuning knobs" (such as incubation times or reagent
concentrations) that can be varied when the protocols are
scheduled. The researcher strings together protocols into processes
specified in <i>Oyster</i>, specifying how the output samples of one
protocol become the inputs to other protocols, and how protocols
can be scheduled, parallelized, and controlled.</p>

<p>Protocols and processes are scheduled and presented to technicians on
touchscreen monitors placed throughout the lab. Every step is logged:
who performed the step, which items were used, what data was gathered
by which instruments, and how long it took. Color and depth sensing
video cameras aimed at the technician, and other sensors sprinkled
throughout the lab, record the details of each step and are used to
annotate an automatically generated a lab notebook. The data can be used to
debug and improve the experiment. More importantly it provides a
complete, executable description of the results obtained -- one that
could be used by any lab running Aquarium to reproduce the result!</p>
