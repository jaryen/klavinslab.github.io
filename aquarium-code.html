<h1>Code</h1>

<p>
The Aquarium software consists of several parts: (a) The core software
  that does inventory management, interpretation of Plankton
  protocols, and scheduling of Oyster metacols; (b) Plankton protocols
  (which we think of as code); (c) Manta, which manages video and
  other sensor data; (d) Squid, which manages devices such as scales,
  printers, spectophotometers, etc.; (e) Angler, which manages
  images.

<p>We are currently figuring out our software license.</p>
