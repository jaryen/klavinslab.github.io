      <div class='software-description'>
	<p>A turbidostat is a feedback controlled continuous culture device that keeps cell 
	density constant.  Commercially available turbidostats are not designed with academic 
	research goals (such as long term evolution or synthetic circuit characterization) in 
	mind and as a result tend to be too large and have inflexible proprietary software.  
	We've designed an inexpensive, open source, 3D printable, eight vessel turbidostat that can be 
	constructed with commodity parts and open source circuits.  Our design is programmed 
	with an open source extensible Python interface that can used to expand the 
	functionality beyond a standard turbidostat.  Presently we are using this device to 
	grow microbes in a constant environment for days to weeks while sending chemical 
	signals to characterize gene circuits in bacteria or yeast. Our collaborators at UW, 
	Rice and UC Berkeley have assembled copies own using our designs with their own 
	modifications.  Complete designs and assembly instructions can be found at the 
	<a href='https://depts.washington.edu/soslab/turbidostat/pmwiki/'>turbidostat wiki</a>.</p>

	<p>We have made many robot testbeds in which robots self
	  assemble or self organize. In one such testbed, triangular
	  'programmable parts' were stirred randomly on an air table and
	  self-assembled into preprogrammed shapes. In another, our
	  'robotic chemistry' parts behaved like molecules in a
	  chemical reaction that was controllable by light
	  input. Designs and specifications for these robots, that you
	  can read about on our <a
	  href='publications.html'>publications page</a>, are available
	  upon request.
