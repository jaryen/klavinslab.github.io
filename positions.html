  <h3>Undergraduates</h3>

  <p>Undergrads can get involved in synthetic biology research through <a href="https://vip.uw.edu/teams/DAWGMA">DAWGMA</a>
    - a new team of undergraduate students doing independent research on synthetic biology, advised and mentored by the
    Klavins lab.</p>

  <h3>Postdoctoral Scholars</h3>

  <p>The Klavins lab is regularly screens candidates with expertise in the following: protein engineering, RNASeq,
    FlowSeq, synthetic biology, machine learning, and software engineering.
    Candidates with experience with both laboratory methods and information technology are of particular (and almost
    exclusive) interest.
    Note that the lab is no longer taking candidates wanting to study robotics.
  </p>

  <h3>Graduate Student Research Assistant</h3>

  <p>The Klavins lab is always seeking highly motivated, independent
    graduate students in computer engineering, bioengineering, and
    biology for a variety of projects ranging from building gene
    networks that compute to developing an automated research
    laboratory. We accept students in many departments, including EE, CSE, BIOEN, MolES, and Biology.
    Positions, as always, are subject to funding decisions that are usually beyond our control.
