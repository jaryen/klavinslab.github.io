  <h3>Postdoctoral Scholar</h3>

  <p>The Klavins lab has open positions for postdoctoral scholars in
  synthetic biology for highly motivated, creative, and independent
  researchers. Candidates with engineering backgrounds should have
  experience in software engineering, programming language design,
  system identification, manufacturing, and/or feedback control
  systems. Candidates with biology backgrounds should have experience
  in synthetic biology, molecular biology, biochemistry, microbiology,
  plant biology, or a similar area. The ideal candidate has experience
  in both engineering and biology. Klavins lab research includes the
  design and construction of engineered gene networks and synthetic
  multicellular systems applied to wide range of problems from
  cell-based diagnostics to biofuel production. Our interdisciplinary
  group takes an engineering approach to all aspects of synthetic
  biology, from exploring the computational expressibility of
  biological pathways to developing software that controls laboratory
  processes. We collaborate with plant biologists, evolutionary
  biologists, computer engineers, and control systems engineers.</p>
  
  <h3>Graduate Student Research Assistant</h3>

  <p>The Klavins lab is always seeking highly motivated, independent
  graduate students in computer engineering, bioengineering, and
  biology for a variety of projects ranging from building gene
  networks that compute to developing an automated research
  laboratory.</p>
  
  <h3>Programmer</h3>

  <p>The Klavins lab has a position open for a computer programmer to
  work on the <a href="aquarium.html">Aquarium</a> project. Prior
  experience in web development with MySQL, Ruby/Rails, and jQuery is
  required. The ideal candidate is also an expert in one or more of
  the following: programming language design, user interface design,
  embedded system programming, or laboratory management systems.</p>

  <h3>System Adminimstrator</h3>

  <p>The Klavins lab is seeking a part time system
  administrator. Duties include managing windows and linux machines,
  installing and updating software, purchasing and installing
  computers, evaluating and installing new software, developing
  scripts, managing data, developing and managing backup systems, and
  managing systems that control scientific equipment.</p>
  
  <h3>Undergraduate Laboratory Assistant</h3>

  <p>The Klavins Lab is seeking UW undergraduate laboratory assistants
  to support experimental activities in systems and synthetic biology
  with <a href="aquarium.html">Aquarium</a>. Duties include preparing
  media, pouring plates, molecular cloning, collecting data,
  monitoring experiments, cleaning and sterilizing equipment and
  glassware, and general laboratory maintenance. Our lab uses a
  sophisticated computer system to manage samples and
  protocols. Training will be provided. Strong computer skills and at
  least one laboratory class in biochemistry or related discipline are
  required. We are looking for at least a one-year
  commitment. Sophomores and juniors are ideal.</p>
